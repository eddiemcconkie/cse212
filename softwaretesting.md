[Article](https://www.stickyminds.com/article/problem-solving-software-testing-conversation) by Ajay Balamurugadas

**Summary:** The Author talks about a friendâ€™s company that had a growing QA Testing team. Over time the team and the product expanded, and the number of test cases for the product grew to over a thousand. They saw the need to automate their testing, but switching from manual to automated introduced several new problems. The team wanted to find a single tool that could help solve their problem.


## Brainstorm Issue
**Risks:**
1. How hard will it be to manage the expansion of the company?
2. Is it worth the cost for the company to switch to automated?
3. How will the company recover from the lack of documentation?
4. Are there other solutions that could prove more effective?
5. Could the changes to the testing team/procedure have any negative consequences for the company?


## Identify the Risk
| Issue | Variables                                      | Risk Level |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| 1     | Onboarding process / Workplace capacity        | Medium     |
| 2     | Cost / usability of new software               | Medium     |
| 3     | Test documentation / Current testing team      | High       |
| 4     | Available automation software / Company budget | Low        |
| 5     | Employee training / Loss of productivity       | Medium     |


## Brainstorm Mitigation

## Test for Mitigation
1. As the company expands they need to make sure that their workplace is sufficiently large to handle the increased number of employees. They also need to prepare onboarding for the new employees.
2. The company needs to look at the requirements of their software to see if they can continue with manual testing, or if it will be worth the effort to switch to automation software.
3. The current testing team has all the knowledge on the testing procedures for the software. They can make the transition smoother by creating better documentation and helping train the new employees.
4. The company should evaluate different automation testing softwares to see which option will prove most useful for the company's needs and will fit within their budget.
5. The company should prepare for the transition by making sure they have a good training program for the new employees. They shoud find ways to streamline the process so that there is not a loss of productivity for the team.
